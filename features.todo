As per article:

 ☐ research gesture support on React and fiber (mobile UI)
 ☐ spike: a offline storage test (app data) in browser's web context: set, get
 ☐ spike: how to determine whether app has run once at least in web context: localStorage?
 ☐ spike: drag gesture use on mobile: show crosshair on where user's finger goes
